// Learing github now

git clone (https,ssh,github cli)
git add-> tell git I would like to add a file as one to track next time I make a commit
the step is needed because if we are working on ten different files and if I want to add only three because I am still working on the other.
git commit -m "message"-> the message property tells what changes we have made recently so that they can be used later. Now we dont see this on the github because whatever we have made did only to the local repository now we have to push it to the github
git status -> gives what is going on in the local repository with respect to the github
git push-> going to push it to the github
git commit -am-> git commit all the files that have been changes with the message

//Until now we have pushed to the git hub let us pull some from the github and let us do it
git pull-> pulles the latest code that is on the github

//Merge conflicts
